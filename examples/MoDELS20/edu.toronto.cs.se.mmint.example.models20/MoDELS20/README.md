[MMINT-A 2.0: Tool Support for the Lifecycle of Model-Based Safety Artifacts](https://doi.org/10.1145/3417990.3422012)

In recent years, the complexity of safety-critical systems such as automotive systems has been rapidly increasing. The need to address safety concerns in such systems led to the development of industry-specific safety standards. The standards mandate activities that generate model-based safety artifacts (e.g., safety cases and fault trees). Given the importance of these safety models, tool support is needed to facilitate manipulating them throughout their lifecycle while maintaining their connection to system models. In this paper, we report on MMINT-A 2.0, an extended version of our tool MMINT-A, aimed to facilitate the creation, analysis, and evolution of safety models. We demonstrate the tool-supported methodology of MMINT-A 2.0 on an automotive example.
