[Querying Automotive System Models and Safety Artifacts: Tool Support and Case Study](https://doi.org/10.2991/jase.d.200912.001)

The automotive domain has recently increased its reliance on model-based software development. Automotive models are often heterogeneous, large and interconnected through traceability links. When introducing safety-related artifacts, such as Hazard Analysis, fault tree analysis (FTA), failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and safety cases, querying these collections of system models and safety artifacts becomes a complex activity. In this paper, we define generic requirements for querying megamodels and demonstrate how to run queries in our Model Management INTeractive (MMINT) framework using the Viatra query engine. We apply our querying approach to a vehicle's Lane Management System case study through the process of its creation and maintenance, perform a comparison with an Object Constraint Language (OCL)-based approach and show how queries can help achieve compliance with the ISO 26262 standard.
