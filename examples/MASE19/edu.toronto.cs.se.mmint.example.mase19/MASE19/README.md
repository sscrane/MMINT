[Querying Automotive System Models and Safety Artifacts with MMINT and Viatra](https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00008)

In recent years, the automotive domain has increased its reliance on model based-software development. Models in the automotive domain have the qualities of being heterogenous, large and interconnected through traceability links. When introducing safety related artifacts, such as HAZOP, FTA, FMEA and safety cases, querying these collections of system models and safety artifacts becomes a complex activity. In this paper, we define generic requirements for querying megamodels and demonstrate how to run queries in our MMINT framework using the Viatra query engine. We apply our querying approach to the Lane Management System from the automotive domain through three different scenarios and compare it to an OCL-based one.
